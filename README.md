We are on a mission to make the process of buying and selling easier and more convenient - and with your help, it will be possible.
But before we work together, we would like to see your programming skills. 
Please find a small assignment below, that we would love for you to complete.

# YOUR TASK

## Finish the project for fetching the public gists from github
This project is designed to gather information about your frontend skills by completing this project.

This project is almost ready to work, All the setup is baked in already.

Add dependencies for `[@octokit/rest](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18/)` for getting the data from github.

We believe, for an ideal candidate, this should not take more than an hour or two.

## Whats Expected

There are number of things we are looking in the project.

- Create a list of public gist available
- Search Gists for the username
- Use state management to save data and not make duplicate calls.
- Show all the relevant meta data available in the response
- We do expect you to use create proper component hierarchy and keep the service and components exclusive.
- Please use git version control.



## Good to have

- Proper handling of error message and no results screens.
- Clean UI (desing your own ui or follow design_inspiration.png as provided)
- Unit Tests
- Optimized rendering.
- Code comments for better understand and evaluation. 
- Type checking of the params.
